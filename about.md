My name is [Greg Cowin](https://about.me.gc). I am a software developer, consultant, speaker, and author. I love F# and functional design, but also do a lot of C# and object-oriented designâ€”mostly .NET projects.

I have been fortunate to work on amazing projects with outstanding people.

I started a medium publication [function of disruption](https://www.medium.com/fnDisruption) recently.
