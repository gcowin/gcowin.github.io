Consulting Patterns
-------------------

FTE Replacement: too expensive; cost reduction
+ training
+ knowledge transfer
+ look for next boulder
+ identify other areas to get faster (and potentially cheaper): qa, ba, pm
+ Show ROI; focus on ROI
+ Align cost with goals

Questionable Work
+ why? 
+ introduce: measure + learn => to know what is working and what is waste of time
+ OKR: objections and key results

Underutilization
+ lean in 
+ help with decision making perhaps from analysis perspective
+ allow it?
+ be present

Blame Culture
+ avoid or change?
+ use process to change
+ do you want to be one more dead body in the field?

General
+ Start adding value at first meeting; be naked
+ be radically transparent; could help with all patterns
+ Offer gifts, not demands

Ignoring Evidence
+ 

Not Included
+ lean in
+ ask the right questinos
+ be grateful

Not Aligned
+ 

Ego
+ Most consultants are pretty full of themselves bc they have been performing; the problem: ego is the enemy
+ Can lead right to bad culture; bad decisions; bad outcomes;
