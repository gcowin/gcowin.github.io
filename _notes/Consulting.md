Consulting Patterns
-------------------

FTE Replacement: too expensive
+ training
+ knowledge transfer
+ look for next boulder
+ identify other areas to get cheaper help: qa, ba, pm

Questionable Work
+ why? 
+ introduce: measure + learn => to know what is working and what is waste of time
+ OKR: objections and key results

Underutilization
+ lean in 
+ help with decision making perhaps from analysis perspective
+ allow it?
+ be present

Blame Culture
+
