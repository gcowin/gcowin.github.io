**Time Complexity**
Put simply, Big O notation maps a pattern of how an algorithm will respond to a given set of inputs:

O(1) algorithms react the same regardless of what input size they’re fed. 

O(N) algorithms react linearly to the inputs they’re given.  A million data points? Expect it to run a million times slower than with just one.

O(N2) algorithms react exponentially to the inputs they’re given. Every input gets squared as it’s processed. Think of an algorithm that has to look over data twice on each iteration. With a dataset that’s twice as large as another, you’ll quickly see an exponential burst of time when it comes to how slowly that algorithm is going to deal with different sized datasets.
