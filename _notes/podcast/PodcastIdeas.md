Could get presidential quotes here to make funny transitions for podcast; although probably a lot of work, but could be interesting from sound perspective

Knowledge Illusion
+ Provide refs/links stand on shoulders; 
Rare gem

Commit to 10 Episodes (solo), but want to get more of a conversation on topics/tradeoffs etc. So looking for other developers to break thru the illusion. Don't rule yourself out if you don't have much experience or whatever the reason. If you feel you have a good question, observation, or hypothesis or counter argument, let me know.

+ Why? What's in it for them?
    frustrated developers
    help with common issues in software development
    help with project issues and conflicts
    prepare developers for disruption
    help cope with radical changes coming in our industry
    help you not turn out to be a frustrated developer
    go beyond the dogma
    blind spots-

    my 25+ years of experience developing software
    Why am I doing it? 
    I want to get past the illusion. The illusion of explanatory depth.
    Aren't there developers like me? Share. Find my tribe. Not ones that just agree.

    Flow and waste
    What and why? help is great way to channel my ego; voice; find my tribe; prepare developers for disruption

    Style
    Like talking to a kind developer -- at first with no feedback 
    
+ Screw best practices and dogma
+ Why is software so important?

+ Why is software delivery so painful?
    + 85% wasted tasks
    + Increased complexity; it's so hard sometimes to just collect the dots; let alone connect them; but i do like that last part.
    + Poor operating models
    + Egos
    + Lack of focus
    + Asked to build the wrong thing
+ Remote working vs open area
+ Functional programming
+ Why managing sucks?
+ Digital transformation

Other ideas
+ Flow
+ ML Types
+ Functional programming and patterns
+ Defensive programming
+ Don't be too full or yourself; legends in our field
+ Wasted youth; wasted retirement; waste at most one. Get tuff.



Flow
----
A tip you can use right now to get into a state of flow
 
Why?
My gut feeling is that you need  flow state and are frustrated by interruptions, distractions, and xyz. At times, I see this feeling on the face of developers.
 
And I have been guilty of interrupting a team's flow many times in the past. This is a crime usually committed by a technical lead or project manager. 
 
What is flow?
Flow is a peak performance state where you are hyper-focused. Your inner critic goes silent. Time can feel sped up or slowed down when in a state of flow.
 
The tip: Stop thinking about yourself
You are probably not going to be able to get into a state of flow around solving a problem, if all you can think about is yourself. Also, thinking about yourself is likely to get yourself a little more anxious and even in analysis paralysis. But there is no better trigger for me, than switching thoughts of me off, and turning thoughts of the problem on. the problem (or task). 
 
How?
Take care of your predominant thought pattern. In my case, I usually have to plan my next meal. Hopefully, you can relate or at least smile at this thought pattern. Perhaps, writing it down and sequencing your day can help if you have too many thoughts that are overpowering.
 
What to do instead?
Focus on the problem to solve (stare at it; don't look away).
 
My recent experience
I wrote down this tip to share on a Saturday morning after reflecting on the state of flow that I had on Friday. It felt great. I was able to get into this flow state several times throughout the waking day. And better, I was able to accomplish something that could have taken a week for me in a different environment. It wasn't brutal. I took breaks; went for a long walk; had good meals; not all work.
 
In a traditional corporate environment, I feel lucky to get in a state of flow for a couple hours a day. Yesterday, I got into that state of deep work several times for a period of over 12 hours.
 
There are many other things that can help you get into a flow state: sleep, not too much caffeine, good environment, minimize distractions, minimize interruptions, and even lighting, but one that can help immediately every time is to stop thinking about yourself.
 
What are your ideas for getting into a state of flow?
I want to quickly get to a flow state again and again. It is fulfilling.
 
Perhaps, we would be better off measuring the state of flow of a team and improving it rather than measuring the utilization of resources and trying to optimize them. Check out this related medium article for more on this:
 
If you think there is something to this idea, then here are a few references to explore more:
 
"Deep Work" by Cal Newport
 
Also, consider reading "Deep Work" by Cal Newport for tips on how to get into a flow state in a distracted world.
 
I believe that I will be able to get into that state over the next year more than I ever have -- even in my 20s. And even more in the coming years. Although the flow state is not all joy and happiness, it is very satisfying.
 
 
The person who says it can't be done should not interrupt the person doing it. -- Chinese proverb
