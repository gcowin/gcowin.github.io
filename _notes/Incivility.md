Incivility Workplace Notes
--------------------------
It is a silent epidemic.

**Snark vs Banter**
I understand banter and snark (had just brothers). Maybe there is a difference. An unhealthy line (classifier).

Defn: Snarky - The act of being sarcastic and dissrespectful.
Defn: Banter - the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks.


Q: What is it snarky really?

A: A defense mechanism, Lack of understanding (and wants more), Disrespect, About feeling important (ego)

The problems with snark:
+ Does not lend itself to thoughtful disagreement
+ Leads to conflict and disrespect; even hate
+ Leads to back biting -- very harmful for a project, company, family or team

A 2016 study by Michigan State University found that incivility spreads in the workplace. Researchers discovered that individuals who were subjected to snarky behavior, like sarcasm and put-downs, wasted their mental energy trying to interpret the individual’s intentions.

 “ambiguous intent”

 Snark.
 Response: sarcasm, disrespect. What is snark? Or maybe it is a put-down disguised as a joke. Either way this kind of communication is what leads to incivility in the workplace. Why should you care?

Why should you care?
--------------------
A survey conducted by Porath and Pearson (2013) of 800 managers and employees in 17 industries revealed the following ways people who have been on the receiving end of uncivil behaviour have responded:
48% intentionally decreased their work effort
47% intentionally decreased the time spent at work
38% intentionally decreased the quality of their work
80% lost work time worrying about the incident
63% lost work time avoiding the offender
66% said that their performance declined
78% said that their commitment to the organisation declined
12% said that they left their job because of the uncivil treatment
25% admitted to taking their frustration out on customers.

Creativity suffers
Performance and team spirit deteriorate


How to deal?
+ Point out the study and negatives
+ Know when to speak up and shut up
+ Stay true to you values


Unfortunately, one snarky individual can lead to mass incivility, if you’re not careful. 

Back biting Triple Filter Test (OR)
1. Is it true
2. Is it good
3. Is it useful

is it true || is it good || is it useful

Negative communication patterns:
1. My dog is bigger than your dog
2. Yes, but...
