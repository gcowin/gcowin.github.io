[Why managers are always a bad idea](https://www.intheblack.com/articles/2018/07/01/why-managers-bad-idea)

**Notes**

Is your company addicted to serving hierarchies, or getting things done? 
The problem with the chain of command is that, while it enhances the power of the manager, it fails to serve the company.

While it is incredible dumb, most companies continue to allow managers to exist, slow things down, and gum up the works with power struggles and politics, in the face of simple logic that says they donâ€™t add value. 

In the lattice organisation, there are no managers, or inboxes and outboxes at multiple levels, or politics and departmental fiefdoms to wade through.

Bill Gore, co-inventor of Gore-Tex and founder of the US$3.3 billion company W.L. Gore & Associates, understood the idea implicitly and built his entire company around self-managed teams and the absence of managers of any kind. In 1976, he published a simple paper called The Lattice Organization that described how a company of any size (Gore has 10,200 staff) could run much better without managers. He expressed the simplicity of an organisation designed around the lattice concept with an illustration.

The message: collaborate with whomever you need to, whenever you need to, without ever going through a manager to get to anyone.

To avoid bureaucracy and to reach for that doubling of human capabilities, the company uses the lattice, which has these characteristics:
No fixed or assigned authority;
Sponsors, not bosses;
Natural leadership defined by followership;
Person-to-person communication;
Objectives set by those who must make them happen; and
Tasks and functions organized through commitments.
