Freud’s model of the ego’s structure has three parts . . .
The Id
Ego
Super-Ego
 
Although Freud defines a clearly identifiable role for each of these three parts they are each integral parts of the whole generally called the ego.
 
1. The Id is that inaccessible part of the personality that we know little about. It contains everything that is inherited, all that is in our genes. The mind of a newborn child is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses that need immediate satisfaction. Later in our development, the id, is responsible for the basic drives for food, water, and sex. It is conscious only of itself and has “no” limitations. It is regarded as the center of the basic instinctive drive to create.
 
2. The Ego’s objective is to please and satisfy the Id’s drives and impulses. It is the organizing part of the personality. Being aware of our consciousness is a function of the ego. It organizes and informs us when our thoughts make sense and are congruent with the world about us. It also defines what is real.
 
3. The third aspect is the Super-Ego. It strives for perfection. Largely unconscious yet leaves us instinctively knowing there is something more than the physical, observable world. This is where the individual’s ideals and spiritual beliefs reside. It is also where confusion within the individual’s stem . . . since the Id and the Super-Ego often contradict each other. For example, the Id demands instant gratification but the Super-Ego hold its values and a sense of right and wrong. This result’s in a bewilderment or confusion we may all familiar with.
 
Motivation and the Ego
In our modern everyday world the ego . . . which literally means “I myself”. . . is often used to describe a sense of inflated self-esteem, only being interested in one’s self. Usually this expression is used in a negative context. To be puffed-up with self-importance . . . “He thinks a lot of himself!” In truth it is not negative at all but a healthy lesson from the Super-Ego.
