Category Theory for Programmers
-------------------------------
by Bartosz Milewski

Q: What is Category Theory?

+ Unification theory for mathematics
+ Inspired by the fact that Einstein's theory of relativity was just so different than other mathematical models
+ 19
Category theory was invented in the early 1940s by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane. It was specifically designed to bridge what may appear to be two quite different fields: topology and algebra; https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1945-058-00/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6/

Tools
-----
Abstraction
+ Get rid of unneccesary details
+ Things that used to be different are now identical; replacing an eight ball

Composition

Identity
+ Is identity and isomorphism the same thing?

Category theory is about Composition and Identity

Q: What is a category?
A: Bunch of objects. Sometimes sets.  a class is less precise than set. All dogs.
Objects and morhpisms

Morphism: A -----> B
              f

Cannot define the set of all sets.

Q: What is identity?
A: left-identity, right-identity. Like 1 with *. 0 with +. 

Q: What is composition?
A:  

Associativity.

A category has to have associativity.

If the category is a set, then it is called a "small category" otherwise "large category"


Q: What is simpliest view of a type?
A: A set of values.

Mathematical function maps one set to another.
A -> B

Category of Sets
----------------
Function composition works on sets
Set -> Set -> Set

Composition of functions is associative.
