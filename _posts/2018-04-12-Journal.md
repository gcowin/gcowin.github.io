**Why?**
 
Q: Why doesn't imperative code come with the same side-effect warnings as OTC medication?

A: Imperative could cause disorientation, confusion, and general sense of worry. Imperative can cause outbreaks of NullPointer, Application, and other exceptions. Use caution when integrating. Leakage of memory and other resources have been reported. Do not use Imperative when operating in production. Insomonia, thoughts of suicide, spontaneous outbreaks of profanity can occur.  Please use Imperative responsibly. Do not use Imperative if you are using any other imperative code. 

Be sure to ask a functional developer before using Imperative.

Be pro-stuff not anti-stuff
