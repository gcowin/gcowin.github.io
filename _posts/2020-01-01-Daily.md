Don't speak negatively about yourself, even as a joke. Your body doesn't know the difference. Words are energy and cast spells, that's why they call it spelling. Change the way you speak about yourself and you can change your life. What you're not changing, you're also choosing. - Bruce Lee

Q: What percentage of time should be used collaborating? Or what general percentage?
A: This might be more of a range; where there are pros/cons for each level. 

0-10%:  getting things done; but right things?
10-25%:  
25-50%: 
50-75%:     
75-100%: probably not getting much done; facilitator

I suspect the sweet spot might be closer to 25% or less for most roles.

TUE MAY 5
---------
Problem Solving Patterns: need references like to "Ways to solve problems" from around 1931.

    pattern: pause. zoom out. (and first principles).

        context: when you are stuck either in a solution or problem space

        what to do: take a moment and pause. zoom out to what is really important. use first principles to do what is probably right. the fundamental truths or goals.

        advice: perhaps should be top of list bc blindspot for most people (me)

        examples: one non-math or cs example of first principles: the goal of a comedian is to make people laugh. steve martin used first-principles to violate one of the most important rules/patterns in comedy which was to release the laughter with a punch line. martin uses no punch lines. he went to first principles.

        references:
            How to think like a rocket scientist

    pattern: soln backwards
        context: 

        what to do: start at soln and work backwards to what is feasible


    pattern: stepping stones

        ref: kent beck

    pattern: big bang

    pattern: parallel paths

        context: mission critical change

        what to do: develop new system parallel to existing system. and compare results at key integration pts. soak test on real data.

        ref: kent beck

    pattern: problem space to soln space
        define

    pattern: embrace your current problem
        there is just going to be another one.

    pattern: move on

    pattern: we chose x in support of y accepting downside z

Probably looks bad to even try to answer this question. Language is a part of us.

Putting down the bad gives no peace.

The further a society drifts from the truth the more it will hate those who speak it. - george orwell

If Neanderthals had a modern-like (spoken) language-like capacity, then it stands to reason this derived from the common ancestor they shared with humans: Homo heidelbergensis. 


SUN FEB 16

Q: How does understanding of the problem flow to a dev team typically?
A: From BAs, scrum masters, and stake holders. but usually do not start trying to understand until sprint planning. This can be the bottleneck. Sometimes made longer by needs of stake holder or other role not being prepared or to make their life easier.

WED FEB 5
---------
Inspired by a statement from Rob C.

A successful client might not be responsive to your list of suggested changes/tools and technologies to incorporate. They've probably made lots of $ without the need of your best practices and dogma. Your goals do not appear to be aligned from the client's perspective.

I've seen a principal consultant come to a successful client with a list of at least 10 technologies to incorporate including a rule-based system to an already complex project. Probably done close to it myself. Maybe I had 15. Who knows. 

I'm not even sure what the total license cost would have been. But some consultant can't just come in with a one million dollar list and expect a smart successful business to say yes. They've been pitched in all sorts of ways to spend $. If you were to add 5 more to you list in hopes of getting top 3, then you'll like be viewed as someone that is all over the map. Not focused. While a few of the suggestions might have warranted consideration, his ideas and credibility were turpedoed.

Don't believe I've come to a client with a list that big but sure I've made this mistake many times in retrospective.

He would have been better off studying decision making than making those recommendations.

Good to realize: In general, most people are not going to follow your recommendations even if you are considered an expert. But they likely want to hear them.

What to do?
    Be open minded.
    Be minimal with growth mindset.
    Defer recommending best practices and technologies or do it slowly. Because the company was able to become successful without the need of your best practices and dogma.
    Listen more.
    Make the hard recommmendation.
    You'd better cut your list down and be very focused on what it is they're getting.
What not to do?
    Have a manifesto

Spark vs Hadoop

Apache spark is faster than Hadoop because it operates by ingesting all the data, performing the required operations/analytics on the data and writing it out to the disk in one full shot. Apache Hadoop on the other hand has an intermediate disk write between operations, and thus it’s slower. Even today, I/O seems to be the costliest operation though the advent of SSDs has reduced it by quite a good margin.

Another important reason for Apache Spark’s speed is it’s in-memory data processing capabilities.

Spark was purpose built with real-time capabilities and on-the-fly processing (read stream processing), whereas Hadoop was optimised for bulk processing.

Spark is supposed to be 100x faster than Hadoop when used in-memory and 10x faster even when using disk I/O.

Q: What are implications if P=NP?
A: 
Crypto broken. Not necesarily fast, but always crackable.
Crypto currency markets disrupted; way to generate coins faster than everyone else;

Probably the way to make real money. Definitely more than $1 million prize. At least a billion. If not a trillion.

Q: What is downside of default objects?
A: Serializing as Json. rather than null fields they will have value. just noisier. Not sparse.

Politics: the cesspool of humanity is running the world

Q: Is politics the cesspool of humanity and why is a cesspool running the world?
A: Seems so. Probably why governments lie so much.

Will it change?
Likely.

What will it require?
A lot more transparency. Less progaganda/news reporters. Or we need real reporters. some kind of real check or accountability. And counter checks. Trust but verify.

Windows Performance Index for Windows 10
1. cmd: winsat formal
2. powershell: get-wmiobject -class win32_winsat

Statusing can take a lot of time, money, and energy. And doesn't add much value in group performance -- other than, how do I fit in and how can I contribute?

It can also lead to disappointment since the status is usually tied to someelse's view of the situation

Made the most of my screen time. And there was a lot.

Future A.
It's hard as a parent not to strive to be perfect. To be the best for you. But no one is. I hope I showed you how to process thru it; with love and support. 

It's core, it gives an ability to find a way to get thru anything.

----------
Q: Is functional code incomprehensible to those that aren't familar w/ fp? And is there something simple that could change that?
A: Probably as Significant as was OO was to OO programmers. 

Q: What can be done quickly/efficiently -- like explaining parens in lisp: (f x) is just f(x)?
A: Definitely would be language dependent. Need to explain the call from the impl.

F#
--
let y = f x

Algebra Notation
y = f(x)
No.

The key: pipeline.

Scala
-----
The functional idea that everything needs a parameter and a return value. Mostly, Not doing but projecting.

Pure/Avoid mutability. Great benefit.

Needs some investment of time like OO did. Is it more or less? Hard to say. So assume about equivalent.

Idea: start w/ linq
    Immutable
    Params and returns
    HOFs
    function calls

From previous:
Escaping velocity notes - doc norton
    what is velocity? some # of work units / unit of time
    once velocity stabilizes metric doesn't help
    velocity is not the goal -- once you put a goal as a metric you invalidate it -- it can produce behaviors you are not looking for
    once you set the target, you change the system
    accumulative flow diagram
    the greatest bottleneck is the only one we need to fix

    trailing indicators don't help looking forward

Use instead
    code quality
    lead time: time between initiation and completion
    cycle time: total time from beginning of proces as defined by you and your customer

developer joy (on commit) - leading indicator -- 0 - 5 indicator on commit that indicates quality of code they just worked on
