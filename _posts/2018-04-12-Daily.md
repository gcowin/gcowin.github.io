With blockchain, Proof of Work is burning billions of dollars per year since it requires gas/electricity/computation/currency to cover the transactional costs. Evidentally, this would be more than all traditional scams and thefts combined especially if deployed as a replacement. Of course, CC actually charge the vendor 3% for a transaction -- a significant fee so one could argue that blockchain could be a lot cheaper when applied to currency. There is likely something better than both.

What are the centralized risks in proof of stake?
Leads to a small group of whales. Similar to what happened to bitcoin.

Decay at end of minable coins could lead to crash. Bitmain is example.

Solidity: function modifier
the _; in a modifier represents the function to be executed. so like we thought it continues execution but its not really a return; it's the actual function.

Why blockchain?
Non repudiation. 
{story}
Legal: Non-repudiation refers to a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract.

CS:
A service that provides proof of the integrity and origin of data.
An authentication that can be said to be genuine with high confidence.

Why is it a problem? Many orgs operate that way. CRUD vs transactional. Story.

Explain the diff: update the balance vs add an adjustment transaction.

How do you get non-repudiation?
Non repudiation using block chain: the transactions are sequencially added to the chain based on time. and cryptographically sealed.
Common understanding. Please feel free to challenge or ask questions...

Ethereum
Block chain: about non repudiation

Proof of Authority vs proof of work; 

Proof of work requires gas; ether; a currency for the computation

We are using proof of authority; it requires far less servers and electricity


Proof of authority uses parties or subset of parties involved in contract

Double Spend
One major obstacle to overcome is what, in Bitcoin terms, is called a “double-spend attack”: What happens if two transactions exist in the network that both want to empty an account, a so-called conflict?

The abstract answer to this is that you do not have to care. An order of the transactions will be selected for you, the transactions will be bundled into what is called a “block” and then they will be executed and distributed among all participating nodes. If two transactions contradict each other, the one that ends up being second will be rejected and not become part of the block.

It would get rejected. I'll show how we use modifiers to reject for other reasons in the smart contract.

As part of the “order selection mechanism” (which is called “mining”) it may happen that blocks are reverted from time to time, but only at the “tip” of the chain. The more blocks that are added on top, the less likely it is. So it might be that your transactions are reverted and even removed from the blockchain, but the longer you wait, the less likely it will be.

It's cryptographically sealed

In Ethereum,
There are two kinds of accounts that share the same space:
1. Actors: External accounts that are controlled by public-private key pairs (i.e. humans) 
2. Contracts: contract accounts which are controlled by the code stored together with the account.

The address of an external account is determined from the public key while the address of a contract is determined at the time the contract is created (it is derived from the creator address and the number of transactions sent from that address, the so-called “nonce”).

Q: What is blockchain?
A: These blocks form a linear sequence in time and that is where the word “blockchain” derives from. Blocks are added to the chain in rather regular intervals - for Ethereum this is roughly every 17 seconds.

Q: Is it just too easy to over-design infrastructure with the cloud (Azure and AWS) since it can be just a push a button?

----------
Q: What is the right question?
A: You know it when you see it, but there is something more. 

Solidity Events:
Events are just like normal instance variables of a contract, they can be inherited like any variable. Events are used to return values to the client in case a list of values is to be returned, but we will only examine them as a means to create logs on the blockchain. Events when they are “fired” from a part of the blockchain with the parameters that are supplied to them.

Q: What if there is no dark matter?

Q: Should an expert/consultant have all the answers almost all of the time?

Proof-of-Authority is a replacement for Proof-of-Work, which can be used for private chain setups. It does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a set of “authorities” - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain.

Q: How do you improve a team's focus, flow, and understanding of a problem to be solved?
where flow is the action or fact of moving along in a steady, continuous stream; seems that just about every aspect of software development can benefit by getting in this state at least as individuals.

A: It's definitely possible to improve focus and understanding. Flow is a state. It is possible not to just squeeze out a few more % but to improve doubling or tripling -- at least in regard to thought work. The myth of multi-tasking.



Genesis file
A genesis file is the file used to initialize the blockchain. The very first block, called the genesis block, is crafted based on the parameters in the genesis.json file.

Q: Do you always make sure that developers are fully tasked? Is that what makes your org produce more with better results?

Don't optimize development resources. Optimize focus, flow and understanding to the left of the check-in and for repeatability to the right. There is also evidence from Lean manufacturing that keeping key resources 100% utilized will actually slow you down -- counter intuitive.

Principles behind the Agile Manifesto


We follow these principles: 
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software. 

Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage. 

Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale. 

Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project. 

Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done. 

The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation. 

Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
Agile processes promote sustainable development. 

The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility. 

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential. 

The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams. 

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly. 

To Gabriel:
Thanks Gabriel. I hope you are doing well.

The main point: a bunch of best practices won't lead you to a great system -- likely not even to a good one. Why not follow all the best practices if they are best. We wouldn't blindly follow all the design patterns we could find -- not without proper context which would rule out almost all.

With all the tech and possibilities, it is just too easy to get off the rails. One time, I saw a solution with over 100 VS projects and couldn't demonstrate a single use-case such as sign-in yet, but they had dependency injection, shared kernel, T4s, subdomains, etc. It was quite a thing.

You probably have some stories... 

Oh. Ironically, I do actually follow some best practices.

I, originally, thought that game theory was the study of games -- probably from watching "War Games" where it had checkers, chess, tic-tac-toe, and global thermal nuclear war as options in the movie. The first three are more computational models -- all the info is on the board. The last one is the only one that has game theory applied.  

Defn: Game theory: the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as in logic and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

Solidity Storage
Each account has a persistent memory area which is called storage. Storage is a key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words. It is not possible to enumerate storage from within a contract and it is comparatively costly to read and even more so, to modify storage. A contract can neither read nor write to any storage apart from its own.

NO SINGLE FACTOR HAS MORE IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT THAN “CLEARLY DEFINED GOALS THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN AND SHARED FREELY.”
—DELOITTE REVIEW, 2015

Non-violent communication by Marshal Rosenberg

Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

Assumptions
Two NVC trainers characterize the assumptions underlying NVC as follows:
All human beings share the same needs
Our world offers sufficient resources for meeting everyone's basic needs
All actions are attempts to meet needs
Feelings point to needs being met or unmet
All human beings have the capacity for compassion
Human beings enjoy giving
Human beings meet needs through interdependent relationships
Human beings change
Choice is internal
The most direct path to peace is through self-connection

Intentions
The trainers also say that practicing NVC involves having the following intentions:
Open-hearted living
Self-compassion
Expressing from the heart
Receiving with compassion
Prioritizing connection
Moving beyond "right" and "wrong" to using needs-based assessments
Choice, responsibility, peace
Taking responsibility for our feelings
Taking responsibility for our actions
Living in peace with unmet needs
Increasing capacity for meeting needs
Increasing capacity for meeting the present moment
Sharing power (partnership)
Caring equally for everyone's needs
Using force minimally and to protect rather than to educate, punish, or get what we want without agreement

What? 
Non-violent communication is language that helps us to connect to others and ourselves. Not only language, but strategies for influecing one another

Purpose:

Method:
1. What's alive with you? Get rid of enemy images of people when they don't do something you like.
2. How can we make the world more wonderful?
3. What are our feelings and needs? Are they being met. When they are being met we are happy; when not, painful.
4. If not being met, what could make life better. 
5. Offer as a gift, not a demand

[Why managers are always a bad idea](https://www.intheblack.com/articles/2018/07/01/why-managers-bad-idea)

**Notes**

Is your company addicted to serving hierarchies, or getting things done? 
The problem with the chain of command is that, while it enhances the power of the manager, it fails to serve the company.

While it is incredible dumb, most companies continue to allow managers to exist, slow things down, and gum up the works with power struggles and politics, in the face of simple logic that says they don’t add value. 

In the lattice organisation, there are no managers, or inboxes and outboxes at multiple levels, or politics and departmental fiefdoms to wade through.

Bill Gore, co-inventor of Gore-Tex and founder of the US$3.3 billion company W.L. Gore & Associates, understood the idea implicitly and built his entire company around self-managed teams and the absence of managers of any kind. In 1976, he published a simple paper called The Lattice Organization that described how a company of any size (Gore has 10,200 staff) could run much better without managers. He expressed the simplicity of an organisation designed around the lattice concept with an illustration.

The message: collaborate with whomever you need to, whenever you need to, without ever going through a manager to get to anyone.

To avoid bureaucracy and to reach for that doubling of human capabilities, the company uses the lattice, which has these characteristics:
No fixed or assigned authority;
Sponsors, not bosses;
Natural leadership defined by followership;
Person-to-person communication;
Objectives set by those who must make them happen; and
Tasks and functions organized through commitments.

Q: Is purely functional code easier to refactor than OO code?

A: It's easier to test because it is by definition in isolation. Actually refactoring is probably easier too, but I'm more worried about changes not refactoring. Refactoring simply maintains existing behavior while improving shape of system.


Q: Is functional programming easier to adapt to requirement changes than OOP?

A: Probably depends on the design. But you probably don't reach the limit of understanding -- i.e. able to grok the state change that imperative code can have can be limiting. The what-if's you get with FP and the testability. MISU.

Substrate Independence is a term used to denote how the Mind is a dynamic process and is not tied to a specific set of atoms as the body replaces them often. By understanding that process it is one day hoped that it can be transfered to a more durable configuration other than proteins. Once this has happens the mind would be capable of traveling within a computer network.

CODE OF CONDUCT
Be respectful, be open, and be considerate.

From Principles by Ray Dalio

“Think for yourself to decide
1) what you want
2) what is true, and
3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.”

How to have thoughtful disagreement ()
1. Put our honest pertinent thoughts out on the table,
2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and
3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.

One way is to attach the debugger to a running dotnet test.

Add the following code at beginning of the test you want to debug, to wait the debugger

    while not(System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached) do
      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)
    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break()

Run the tests, usually with dotnet test, who will wait until the debugger is attached

Now in vscode go in Debug, and launch configuration .NET Core Attach.

Select the test process, and debugger should attach go in debugging mode

NOTE you can filter the test to run with dotnet test --filter "TestName"

NOTE see the complete list of tests with dotnet test --list-tests

**Job Titles?**

Q: Are job titles important? Do they improve or hurt group performance?

Seems like titles hurt group performance if best ideas are not winning. "Checking egos at the door ensures that the quality of an idea - not a person’s rank - always wins." - INC. Magazine

Statusing can take a lot of time, money, and energy. And doesn't add much value in group performance -- other than, how do I fit in and how can I contribute?

Q: Are job titles condusive for dynamic teaming?

They don't seem to be good for dynamic teaming, because with dynamic teaming -- different people lead different projects -- and different people assist with those projects. Dynamic teaming seems to be the only way for an org not to cause issues with the architecture. Architecture <-> Organization. Adele Goldberg has great quote.

Q: Do job titles and proper structure reduce waste and improve focus?

Q: Are job titles good for your career?

Most likely yes. But they are institutionally overdone. Could hurt your chances for the next job. You're likely more than the title anyway.

If hiring managers look for it, then it is important.

But what do people really want out of company: be treated fairly and compensated appropriately; work with interesting people and challenging projects.  

Q: If you had any job title you wanted, what would it do?

REMOTE WORKING NOTES

Non-performers don't survive in ROWE environment whereas they might do fine going into the office and not performing. Taking some direction and talking about working alot, but without results. 

Isn't there something wrong with the way we look at work if this is true?

The fact that non-performers are fine if they come in. The implication: we don't know how to manage work so we manage peoples time. Another implication: you don't know how to focus as a company -- one of the areas of biggest waste. At a macro level a manager might be wasting 85% of the effort then expect/pressure devs to work lots of overtime -- essentially making things worse.  

You know how mobile-first allowed us to focus on the truely essential parts of the app, we need to focus the results first and the ability to perform remote work.  Demo or die. 

The mind confuses talking with doing. Leads to a mindset where you want to have everything solved by talking. Waiting for someone to tell you what to do.

Benefits from study
    Lower attrition rates
    Savings $1,900 per employee 
    Increased productivity by 13.5%; equivalent of extra day of work for everyone
    Shorter breaks and fewer sick days; took less time off

Risks
    Jepardize cohesion of your team. Although I find there to be less drama. Scrum and you have at least one meeting per week where anybody can say anything

What is needed?
    Deep work environment

What can you do?

The problem: managers value presense over performance.

This is really about two things: remote working and result-oriented.

Ray Dalio, "What is your recipe for success?" The principles. Write them down. 

Notes from Ray: Principles

You have to be an independent thinker. Whether you are an investor or entrepreneur, you have to think differently. You have to bet against the conscensus and be right. When you go down that path, you are going to be wrong a number of times. Humility.

The fear of being wrong should make you open-minded. I'm either going to have success or I'm going to gain understanding.

Pain + Reflection = Progress

Idea Meritocracy - best ideas win out

The magic: idea metritocracy in which the goals are meaningful work and meaningful relationships which are achieved via radical truthfulness and radical transparency. Radical truthfulness means that anyone can say what they mean. Radical transparency means you can't manipulate the truth.

Simple steps

**Why?**
 
Q: Why doesn't imperative code come with the same side-effect warnings as OTC medication?

A: Imperative could cause disorientation, confusion, and general sense of worry. Imperative can cause outbreaks of NullPointer, Application, and other exceptions. Use caution when integrating. Leakage of memory and other resources have been reported. Do not use Imperative when operating in production. Insomonia, thoughts of suicide, spontaneous outbreaks of profanity can occur.  Please use Imperative responsibly. Do not use Imperative if you are using any other imperative code. 

Be sure to ask a functional developer before using Imperative.
