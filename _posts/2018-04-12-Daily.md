THUR MAY 3
----------
Q: Why are exceptions bad?

A: Goto statement; not functional


Q: What to use instead?

A: Materialized errors instead. A state/type that represents the error and is returned. Only use exceptions for truly exception cases (not recoverable) such as out of memory, stack overflow, ...

Less to test

Q: If you have one impl for one interface, is it an abstraction?

A: Probably not good one.


Q: What if "do one thing" means do one thing?

A:

**Incentive Program**

Q: What should it be based on?

A: Should be based on factors 1. Results 2. Helping/coaching others


Q: What if incentive program is too complicated? 


A: No faith in it if you need a spreadsheet. Impedes problem solving and creativity. 


Q: What about incentive clubs/trips?

A: Great carrot. Could help retention high performers. But exclusive not inclusive. 


WED MAY 2
---------

Q: How to get to 10 X?

A: The only way to get to the next 10x is through reuse. Not w/ complicate parts but with simple composition. More expressive pure languages are needed.

The real problem: we operate in a really poor operational model. Mutation and nulls everywhere. Programmers don't even question the basic von numan operating model.

Q: What are key elements?

A: Composibility (reuse), Isolation (testing), Immutability (understanding, concurrency, integration), Discriminant unions (manage lifecycle; MISU; Type Driven Dev)

**OO**

OO leads to fragility in testing

FactoryFactoryFactory: for when you need a factory for FactoryFactory.

**Meta**

Noticed that I can't put some things in my journal that I used to. I use separate journal for client stuff so not that.   

Where do I put those things? Maybe I could just add gratitude stuff although cheesy sometimes. Leave out names to protect the innocent. Or use first names. Or initials.

[Build 2018 Agenda Available](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions)

Figured out disqus integration. Added conversation page since journal will be reverse chrono journal style.

If you think you have it all figured, then double down on your dogma. Humility will find you faster and maybe success too.

Really liking domain modeling w/ F# -- need to map command to result

"We do not map our actions to our mouths." - gary v

Maybe the real issue with d.i. is that so much gets injected. Lot's of coupling when used in mvc approach.

**Mocks**

If you don't have side-effects, then you don't need mocks in general.


Q: Why so much over-design?

A: With OOP, we have trained an entire software industry to over-abstract. The result: most complexity is self-induced. Some companies have definitely reach this conceptual ceiling already.

"Never work for a bad client in your life. Because from a bad client, you will get a worse client thereafter. If you get a good client to begin, you will get a better client thereafter. It is better to starve than get a bad client, because from a bad client you just go down.

Don’t work for money, because it’s the lousiest profession in the world to make money… You do design because you feel it inside; you have a moral issue to spread quality in our environment." --Massimo Vignelli

**VSCode/Ionide**

VSCode/Ionide How to debug test case? For now.

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/wiki/HOWTO-Debug-a-test
HOWTO Debug a test: 

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp.wiki.git
One way is to attach the debugger to a running dotnet test.

Add the following code at beginning of the test you want to debug, to wait the debugger

    while not(System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached) do
      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)
    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break()

Run the tests, usually with dotnet test, who will wait until the debugger is attached

Now in vscode go in Debug, and launch configuration .NET Core Attach.

Select the test process, and debugger should attach go in debugging mode

NOTE you can filter the test to run with dotnet test --filter "TestName"

NOTE see the complete list of tests with dotnet test --list-tests

**Job Titles?**

Q: Are job titles important? Do they improve or hurt group performance?

Seems like titles hurt group performance if best ideas are not winning. "Checking egos at the door ensures that the quality of an idea - not a person’s rank - always wins." - INC. Magazine

Statusing can take a lot of time, money, and energy. And doesn't add much value in group performance -- other than, how do I fit in and how can I contribute?

Q: Are job titles condusive for dynamic teaming?

They don't seem to be good for dynamic teaming, because with dynamic teaming -- different people lead different projects -- and different people assist with those projects. Dynamic teaming seems to be the only way for an org not to cause issues with the architecture. Architecture <-> Organization. Adele Goldberg has great quote.

Q: Do job titles and proper structure reduce waste and improve focus?

Q: Are job titles good for your career?

Most likely yes. But they are institutionally overdone. Could hurt your chances for the next job. You're likely more than the title anyway.

If hiring managers look for it, then it is important.

But what do people really want out of company: be treated fairly and compensated appropriately; work with interesting people and challenging projects.  

Q: If you had any job title you wanted, what would it do?

REMOTE WORKING NOTES

Non-performers don't survive in ROWE environment whereas they might do fine going into the office and not performing. Taking some direction and talking about working alot, but without results. 

Isn't there something wrong with the way we look at work if this is true?

The fact that non-performers are fine if they come in. The implication: we don't know how to manage work so we manage peoples time. Another implication: you don't know how to focus as a company -- one of the areas of biggest waste. At a macro level a manager might be wasting 85% of the effort then expect/pressure devs to work lots of overtime -- essentially making things worse.  

You know how mobile-first allowed us to focus on the truely essential parts of the app, we need to focus the results first and the ability to perform remote work.  Demo or die. 

The mind confuses talking with doing. Leads to a mindset where you want to have everything solved by talking. Waiting for someone to tell you what to do.

Benefits from study
    Lower attrition rates
    Savings $1,900 per employee 
    Increased productivity by 13.5%; equivalent of extra day of work for everyone
    Shorter breaks and fewer sick days; took less time off

Risks
    Jepardize cohesion of your team. Although I find there to be less drama. Scrum and you have at least one meeting per week where anybody can say anything

What is needed?
    Deep work environment

What can you do?

The problem: managers value presense over performance.

This is really about two things: remote working and result-oriented.

----------
Every design decision comes with a tradeoff. We chose X accepting downside Y in support of Z.

**D.I. (dependency injection)**

- violates single resposibility principle
- increases complexity
- runtime penalty for those that walk all classes in all DLLs
- if you inject something different then why use di?
- privates aren't private
- needless dependencies
- big constructors


**Alternatives**

AbstractFactory

Factory

MON APR 16
----------
**Why?**

Q: Why is dependency injection not so great?

A: Because it is a sauce for spaghetti code. Makes it taste better. A way to scope. But global. Inject needless dependencies. For example, you likely only need one method out of eight. By example, one injects more dep than needed.

60-90 minute segments today.

Q: Why isn't software an engineering?

A: Could be because engineers know about tradeoffs. Software developers (engineers) know the benefits of everything and the tradeoffs of nothing. - needs some credit to rich hickey

Ray Dalio, "What is your recipe for success?" The principles. Write them down. 

Notes from Ray: Principles

You have to be an independent thinker. Whether you are an investor or entrepreneur, you have to think differently. You have to bet against the conscensus and be right. When you go down that path, you are going to be wrong a number of times. Humility.

The fear of being wrong should make you open-minded. I'm either going to have success or I'm going to gain understanding.

Pain + Reflection = Progress

Idea Meritocracy - best ideas win out

The magic: idea metritocracy in which the goals are meaningful work and meaningful relationships which are achieved via radical truthfulness and radical transparency. Radical truthfulness means that anyone can say what they mean. Radical transparency means you can't manipulate the truth.

Simple steps

Step 1: create an environment for candor 

Step 2: understand art of thoughtful feedback and disagreement

Step 3: if you don't have agreement, then how do you need a mechanism to get past it


1st order consequences are usually opposite to 2cd order consquences.

How to make the most out of failure? Micro failures. Macro wins.

I'm not really competitive. I'm driven.

Q: Can you separate yourself from your opinions?

**What?**

What is your recipe for success?
I wish everyone could answer this question. 
Great question. Use it for QED120.

----------

**Why?**
 
Q: Why doesn't imperative code come with the same side-effect warnings as OTC medication?

A: Imperative could cause disorientation, confusion, and general sense of worry. Imperative can cause outbreaks of NullPointer, Application, and other exceptions. Use caution when integrating. Leakage of memory and other resources have been reported. Do not use Imperative when operating in production. Insomonia, thoughts of suicide, spontaneous outbreaks of profanity can occur.  Please use Imperative responsibly. Do not use Imperative if you are using any other imperative code. 

Be sure to ask a functional developer before using Imperative.
