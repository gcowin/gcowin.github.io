SUN JUN 24
----------
Ocean's 8. Just ok.

SAT JUN 23
----------
Self-driving enterprise. 

A.I. is more an evolution on automation -- in most cases.

FRI JUN 22
----------
Q: Why don't saunas sell well in Texas?

A: Days like this.



Q: Can you trust data from sensors?

A: No. Makes automation scary especially driverless cars. Circuit breaker. MISU.


Got #2 at PUBG solo. Got every top 10 position solo. I'm not a very good shot.

THUR JUN 21
-----------
Q: Is purely functional code easier to refactor than OO code?

A: It's easier to test because it is by definition in isolation. Actually refactoring is probably easier too, but I'm more worried about changes not refactoring. Refactoring simply maintains existing behavior while improving shape of system.


Q: Is functional programming easier to adapt to requirement changes than OOP?

A: Probably depends on the design. But you probably don't reach the limit of understanding -- i.e. able to grok the state change that imperative code can have can be limiting. The what-if's you get with FP and the testability. MISU.


WED JUN 20
----------
Q: What goes together best with A.I.?

A: Automation. Some same patterns are used such as Circuit Breaker. Optimization.


TUES JUN 19
-----------
Q: What is better term than Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)? It isn't artificial just different. Blame Minskey and crew.

A: Intelligent Systems. Augmented Intelligence. Amplified Intelligence. 


MON JUN 18
----------
Optimizations going well.

Season 2 West World should be better.

SAT JUN 16
----------
Got to see Dad for father's day and some of his friends. Very nice. 

FRI JUN 15
----------
Q: Does miltary style work for development?

A: Seems like wasteful expensive model to copy. Group performance is associated with diversity and having a say. Commander barking orders doesn't seem inclusive or good for feedback. Also, could give justification for toxic leadership which is also commonly known as culture killer. 

Need references to culture killer.

No Asshole Rule by 
Principles by Ray Dalio
HBR Study about group performance.


THUR JUN 14
-----------
Q: What is clarity?

A: Clarity: Don't ever let your value system become so complex that you can't clearly even know yourself.  

I've codified the buy.

WED JUN 13
----------
Q: Why is decision making so important?

A: We're all just one bad decision away from disaster.


Q: Why isn't decision making more formal?
A:

TUES JUN 12
-----------
Don't waste the pain. 


MON JUN 11
----------
Clarity.  


SUN JUN 10
----------
PUBG and 4 mile walk.

How to Cook a Grenade in PUBG (Xbox)
To cook grenades in PUBG on the Xbox instead, you need to do the following:
Select the Grenade by pressing Right on the D-Pad.
Press and hold the Right Trigger to remove the pin and show the red THROW trajectory preview (OR Press and hold the Left Trigger to roll the grenade instead).
Cook the Grenade by pressing the Left Button.
The 5-second timer has started. Release the Right Trigger to throw (OR the Left Trigger to roll) the grenade!

SAT JUN 9
---------
Q: What do I want?

A: Better projects; better focus; better leadership. 

FRI JUN 8
---------
Got 1st on PUBG for 1st time solo.

THUR JUN 7
----------
If you keep following or giving the advice: don't worry we will fix it later. Worry will find you sooner than later.    

WED JUN 6
---------
The number of states that only 6 integers (32 bit) can represent is larger than the number of atoms in the visible universe. If you want to test all the states that your program can be in, then it is going to take a very long time. 

TUES JUN 5
----------
GitHub is now a hub for azure.

taiichi ohno, father of lean manufacturing, said that emotional waste is the worst kind. 

Most of the time 10X is a thought experiment. Not with my client today.

Funny comments:
I have some ideas to help tomorrow.

None of them involve generating a new resume.

So don't waste the pain.


MON JUN 4
---------
Failure: git failed with a fatal error.early eofthe remote end hung up unexpectedlyindex-pack failedrpc failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining

Resolution:
git config --global core.compression 0
 
git clone --depth 1 <repo_URI>
When that works, go into the new directory and retrieve the rest of the clone: 
git fetch --unshallow 
or, alternately, 
git fetch --depth=2147483647
Now, do a regular pull: 
git pull --all
I think there is a glitch with msysgit in the 1.8.x versions that exacerbates these symptoms, so another option is to try with an earlier version of git (<= 1.8.3, I think). 

SUN JUN 3
---------
Q: Why vaguely assign blame or to motivate? 

A: Could be driven by some kind of bias like Character Attribution Error.

SAT JUN 2
---------
Simple things at the right time.

FRI JUN 1
---------
Time off!

Substrate Independence is a term used to denote how the Mind is a dynamic process and is not tied to a specific set of atoms as the body replaces them often. By understanding that process it is one day hoped that it can be transfered to a more durable configuration other than proteins. Once this has happens the mind would be capable of traveling within a computer network. 

Substrate (biology), the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the surface or medium on which an organism grows or is attached

Q: Curved monitors good for writing code?
A: Likely. Great developers probably don't need much more than VI or notepad, but it helps to have great gear in a competitive world where you go to deliver high value.

I want to try. It's cheap $159 per monitor: https://www.google.com/search?q=Sceptre+27"+Curved+75Hz+LED+Monitor+C278W-1920R&oq=Sceptre+27"+Curved+75Hz+LED+Monitor+C278W-1920R

**Modeling with ML**

Q: Does modeling with ML cause more design blocks or just exposing design issues earlier?

A: Probably just exposes design issues ealier. Still have the ability to ignore areas just like other modeling techniques. Even define ToDo(). And, with ML you can do more with the model. In a sense, make illegal states unrepresentable (MISU).


**GDPR Essence**
Do not being sneaky. If you are honest and transparent and implementing controls, you won’t face the fines that come with GDPR.

Sneaky would be collecting GPS on user and storing it for other purposes than recommending a nearby coffee shop. Or a game doing the same.

CODE OF CONDUCT
Be respectful, be open, and be considerate.

From Principles by Ray Dalio

“Think for yourself to decide
1) what you want
2) what is true, and
3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.”

How to have thoughtful disagreement ()
1. Put our honest pertinent thoughts out on the table,
2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and
3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments.

Q: Why are exceptions bad?

A: Goto statement; not functional


Q: What to use instead?

A: Materialized errors instead. A state/type that represents the error and is returned. Only use exceptions for truly exception cases (not recoverable) such as out of memory, stack overflow, ...

Less to test

Q: If you have one impl for one interface, is it an abstraction?

A: Probably not good one.

Q: What should it be based on?

A: Should be based on factors 1. Results 2. Helping/coaching others


Q: What if incentive program is too complicated?

Q: What about incentive clubs/trips?

A: Great carrot. Could help retention high performers. But exclusive not inclusive. 


WED MAY 2
---------

Q: How to get to 10 X?

A: The only way to get to the next 10x is through reuse. Not w/ complicate parts but with simple composition. More expressive pure languages are needed.

The real problem: we operate in a really poor operational model. Mutation and nulls everywhere. Programmers don't even question the basic von numan operating model.

Q: What are key elements?

A: Composibility (reuse), Isolation (testing), Immutability (understanding, concurrency, integration), Discriminant unions (manage lifecycle; MISU; Type Driven Dev)

**OO**

OO leads to fragility in testing

FactoryFactoryFactory: for when you need a factory for FactoryFactory.

**Meta**

Noticed that I can't put some things in my journal that I used to. I use separate journal for client stuff so not that.   

Where do I put those things? Maybe I could just add gratitude stuff although cheesy sometimes. Leave out names to protect the innocent. Or use first names. Or initials.

Really liking domain modeling w/ F# -- need to map command to result

"We do not map our actions to our mouths." - gary v

Maybe the real issue with d.i. is that so much gets injected. Lot's of coupling when used in mvc approach.

**Mocks**

If you don't have side-effects, then you don't need mocks in general.


Q: Why so much over-design?

A: With OOP, we have trained an entire software industry to over-abstract. The result: most complexity is self-induced. Some companies have definitely reach this conceptual ceiling already.

VSCode/Ionide How to debug test case? For now.

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/wiki/HOWTO-Debug-a-test
HOWTO Debug a test: 

https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp.wiki.git
One way is to attach the debugger to a running dotnet test.

Add the following code at beginning of the test you want to debug, to wait the debugger

    while not(System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached) do
      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)
    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break()

Run the tests, usually with dotnet test, who will wait until the debugger is attached

Now in vscode go in Debug, and launch configuration .NET Core Attach.

Select the test process, and debugger should attach go in debugging mode

NOTE you can filter the test to run with dotnet test --filter "TestName"

NOTE see the complete list of tests with dotnet test --list-tests

**Job Titles?**

Q: Are job titles important? Do they improve or hurt group performance?

Seems like titles hurt group performance if best ideas are not winning. "Checking egos at the door ensures that the quality of an idea - not a person’s rank - always wins." - INC. Magazine

Statusing can take a lot of time, money, and energy. And doesn't add much value in group performance -- other than, how do I fit in and how can I contribute?

Q: Are job titles condusive for dynamic teaming?

They don't seem to be good for dynamic teaming, because with dynamic teaming -- different people lead different projects -- and different people assist with those projects. Dynamic teaming seems to be the only way for an org not to cause issues with the architecture. Architecture <-> Organization. Adele Goldberg has great quote.

Q: Do job titles and proper structure reduce waste and improve focus?

Q: Are job titles good for your career?

Most likely yes. But they are institutionally overdone. Could hurt your chances for the next job. You're likely more than the title anyway.

If hiring managers look for it, then it is important.

But what do people really want out of company: be treated fairly and compensated appropriately; work with interesting people and challenging projects.  

Q: If you had any job title you wanted, what would it do?

REMOTE WORKING NOTES

Non-performers don't survive in ROWE environment whereas they might do fine going into the office and not performing. Taking some direction and talking about working alot, but without results. 

Isn't there something wrong with the way we look at work if this is true?

The fact that non-performers are fine if they come in. The implication: we don't know how to manage work so we manage peoples time. Another implication: you don't know how to focus as a company -- one of the areas of biggest waste. At a macro level a manager might be wasting 85% of the effort then expect/pressure devs to work lots of overtime -- essentially making things worse.  

You know how mobile-first allowed us to focus on the truely essential parts of the app, we need to focus the results first and the ability to perform remote work.  Demo or die. 

The mind confuses talking with doing. Leads to a mindset where you want to have everything solved by talking. Waiting for someone to tell you what to do.

Benefits from study
    Lower attrition rates
    Savings $1,900 per employee 
    Increased productivity by 13.5%; equivalent of extra day of work for everyone
    Shorter breaks and fewer sick days; took less time off

Risks
    Jepardize cohesion of your team. Although I find there to be less drama. Scrum and you have at least one meeting per week where anybody can say anything

What is needed?
    Deep work environment

What can you do?

The problem: managers value presense over performance.

This is really about two things: remote working and result-oriented.

WED APR 18
----------
Every design decision comes with a tradeoff. We chose X accepting downside Y in support of Z.

**D.I. (dependency injection)**

- violates single resposibility principle
- increases complexity
- runtime penalty for those that walk all classes in all DLLs
- if you inject something different then why use di?
- privates aren't private
- needless dependencies
- big constructors


**Alternatives**

AbstractFactory

Factory

Lambda's 


D.I. author's claims of composition/reuse via injection? wow.

what about f: a -> a as a composition strategy?

ServiceLocator
- Glorified static factory

- glorified

**Why?**

Why put logic in services? Why micro?

What is being solved? What are the goals? What are the shortcomings?

MON APR 16
----------
**Why?**

Q: Why is dependency injection not so great?

A: Because it is a sauce for spaghetti code. Makes it taste better. A way to scope. But global. Inject needless dependencies. For example, you likely only need one method out of eight. By example, one injects more dep than needed.

60-90 minute segments today.

Q: Why isn't software an engineering?

A: Could be because engineers know about tradeoffs. Software developers (engineers) know the benefits of everything and the tradeoffs of nothing. - needs some credit to rich hickey

Ray Dalio, "What is your recipe for success?" The principles. Write them down. 

Notes from Ray: Principles

You have to be an independent thinker. Whether you are an investor or entrepreneur, you have to think differently. You have to bet against the conscensus and be right. When you go down that path, you are going to be wrong a number of times. Humility.

The fear of being wrong should make you open-minded. I'm either going to have success or I'm going to gain understanding.

Pain + Reflection = Progress

Idea Meritocracy - best ideas win out

The magic: idea metritocracy in which the goals are meaningful work and meaningful relationships which are achieved via radical truthfulness and radical transparency. Radical truthfulness means that anyone can say what they mean. Radical transparency means you can't manipulate the truth.

Simple steps

Step 1: create an environment for candor 

Step 2: understand art of thoughtful feedback and disagreement

Step 3: if you don't have agreement, then how do you need a mechanism to get past it


1st order consequences are usually opposite to 2cd order consquences.

How to make the most out of failure? Micro failures. Macro wins.

I'm not really competitive. I'm driven.

Q: Can you separate yourself from your opinions?

**What?**

What is your recipe for success?
I wish everyone could answer this question. 
Great question. Use it for QED120.

**Why?**
 
Q: Why doesn't imperative code come with the same side-effect warnings as OTC medication?

A: Imperative could cause disorientation, confusion, and general sense of worry. Imperative can cause outbreaks of NullPointer, Application, and other exceptions. Use caution when integrating. Leakage of memory and other resources have been reported. Do not use Imperative when operating in production. Insomonia, thoughts of suicide, spontaneous outbreaks of profanity can occur.  Please use Imperative responsibly. Do not use Imperative if you are using any other imperative code. 

Be sure to ask a functional developer before using Imperative.

**Logic**

When you think the code is defying logic, it's problably the logic. This lesson, I learn over and over.
