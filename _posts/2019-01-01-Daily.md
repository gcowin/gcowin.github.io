Notes: How to abstract over context by Martin Odersky
----------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiorT754IwA&index=8&t=0s&list=PLDxoMMAEmpqTea71WDnk9bG-HSe0soEIE

**Context is all around us**
+ the current configuration
+ the current scope
+ the security level in effect
+ the user on behalf of which an operation is performed

**Traditional ways to express context**
+ globals
    rigid if immutable
    unsafe if mutable
+ monkey patching (subclassing)
+ dependency injection
    at runtime
    or with macros
+ cake pattern
    close coupling + recursion

**implicit parameters**
def f(a: A)(implicit b: B)

implicit val b = B()

**context parameters**
def f(a: A)(implicit b: B)

In Scala 3.0, is now express as

def f(a: A) with (b: B)
or
def f(a: A) with B

instance ctx for Context { ... }
f("abc")
f("abc") with ctx

Summoning an instance
def summon[T] with (x: T) = x

**context parameters: use cases**
+ prove theorems
+ implement type classes
+ establish context
+ set configuration
+ inject dependencies
+ model capabilities

**Curry Howard isomporphism**
Types = Theorems
Programs = Proofs

D.I.
Needed due more to the inability to do effective composition

Implicits and Contexts
----------------------
Use implicit parameters but almost never implicit conversions.

There are different mechanisms used to support context such as dependency injection, etc.
Implicits in scala support context in a more elegant way.

Implicit is the cononical way to represent contexts such as configuration, access rights, etc.

Aims of Dotty
+ Work out essence of scala
+ strengthen core
+ drop non-essentials

Essential: Foundations
+ Make progress with strong formal foundations
+ The DOT calculus captures the essense of Scala

DOT: Dependent Object Types
The Essence of Dependent Object Types

Looks like they are now called context parameters and have superseeded implicit parameters

Programming Popularity Sources

PYPL: http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html
GitHut: https://githut.info/
IEEE Spectrum: https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages
TIOBE: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/
Top Websites: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

At PYPL this month, Scala is at #15 and none of the others show up.
At GitHut, Scala is at #12, Clojure is at #21, Elixir is at #24, and F# is at #37.
At IEEE Spectrum, Scala is at #15, Clojure is at #40, and none of the other show up.
What we can conclude is that only Scala is reasonably popular. All the other languages are relatively obscure.

If you punish people for making mistakes, then there will be no learning in your organization. Because learning is about mistakes.

My Challenge: have quality back-and-forth. Quality conversation. Quality disagrement. Quality shots.

The ultimate question: how are you going to help me? you are here. you are there. you don't know. you ...

If we do these things... we will get to x by y.

Provide insight.

Do you see what i see?

The problem with yes. Would you like to make more money? 
Yes is always a trap.
Yes mode.
Little yes' lead to big yes'.
Study says it works, but it doesn't.

superficial, narcissistic behavior, superiority complex, 

Perhaps, unauthentic would be better feedback.

Superiority complex
-------------------
 is a psychological defense mechanism that compensates for an inferiority complex. The term was coined by Alfred Adler as part of his school of individual psychology. Afred Adler. Austrian psychotherapist

 "If a person is a show-off, it is only because he feels inferior because he does not feel strong enough to compete with others on the useful side of life. That is why he stays on the useless side. He is not in harmony with society. It seems to be a trait of human nature that when individuals – both children and adults – feel weak, they want to solve the problems of life in such a way as to obtain personal superiority without any admixture of social interest. A superiority complex is a second phase. It is a compensation for the inferiority [feeling] complex."

 Dunning-Kruger Effect: people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess the cognitive ability as grater than it is.

 probably most dangerous: god complex.

Scala case class vs case object
------------------------------
Scala case classes are just regular classes which are immutable by default and decomposable through pattern matching.

A case class which has no arguments is declared as case object instead of case class. case object is serializeable by default.


Way to do discriminant union in Scala

trait PaymentMethod
case class CreditCard (number: string, expiration: Date) extends PaymentMethod
case class Cash (amount: decimal) extends PaymentMethod
case class Check (checkNumber : int) extends PaymentMehotd

Null: a Trait
null: an instance of Null- Similar to Java null
Nil: Represents an emptry List of anything of zero length. It's not that it refers to nothing but it refers to List which has no contents
Nothing is a Trait. It's a subtype of everything. But not superclass of anything. There are no instances of Nothing
None: Used to represent a sensible return value. Just to avoid null pointer exception. Option has exactly 2 subclasses- Some and None. None signifies no result from the method.
Unit: Type of method that doesn’t return a value of anys sort

You need more than somebody's question. You need ask for the theory. Theory: to explain a cause and effect in small amount of words.  [Essence]

Good Data Questions
-------------------
Given data question and using ADL, 
What is the theory? explain cause-effect.
What is the hypothesis? how to test theory.
What is the experiment? ...
What are results? ...

Positive: when you get a question ask for theory. then hypothesis. how to test question. engaging and goodpath. 

Negative: asking question in response to question. sometimes you might have to do all of them.

----------

FRI JAN 18
----------
Theory vs hypothesis
A theory explains a cause-effect relationship nominally, in words. An hypothesis provides a basis for testing a theory by converting those words into measurable variables, which can be codified numerically, from zero-one binary variables to continuous ratio variable  and tested using bivariate or multivariate statistical techniques.

**Snark vs Banter**

A: A defense mechanism, Lack of understanding (and wants more), Disrespect, About feeling important (ego)
