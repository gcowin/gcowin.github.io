Just try to get a flow and focus going.

Most of the wonderful places in the world were not made by architects but by the people. 
Christopher Alexander

The basic problems with data include obsession with primitive types and defaulting to NULL. 

: strings (varchar), ints, decimals, longs, .... And we too often default to NULL. We can't trust that a string is a ValidEmail. It's even worse from an application data perspective.

apply: In mathematics and computer science, Apply is a function that applies functions to arguments.

Little bit like Invoke in C#, but more elegant

THU JUL 11
----------
Setters and getters

Two main issues:
1. Logic in getter; otherwise fine.
2. Setter in general

Problems
+ Mutation
+ Validation logic embedded sometimes but no result


Alternatives
+ don't use setter
+ apply in functional programming
+ immutable types

WED JUL 10
----------
Use cases: I like them but they're not the only way to describe the problem statement. The problem statement is the important thing.  It can be reframed.

Need suggestions for reframing. A list.

Reframing techniques
+ Simplify
+ Side step: Avoid the hard part
+ Restrict
+ Work backwards from desired outcome and restate
+

Event stream processing vs big big data

As an example, the Spark platform supports both big data and event processing.

The rub: batch vs. esp

Yes. Shared Kernel.

+ Usually closer to real-time
What about?
+ processing 

Big Data
+ Done on all of it 
+ Batch
What about?
+ Analytics, and more


FRI JUN 21

Functional thinking: Eric Norman

Pure Functions: calcs and transformations
Actions: side-effects; can depend on time
Data: based on algebraic types

Time dependent: correct time, correct number of times, only one time 

Phases of functional understanding:

Level 1: functions and transformations, hof

Level 2: actions, functions, and data

Level 3: algebraic types

Grateful for Ka in her BA role with MarTech projects at CK. Was part time on project which must have felt like full-time. Thankful for what she has done and helped me with blind spots many times. But most of all, is how much our partner respects her, appreciates her, needs her, and asks her for guidance. She's been there for many deliverables including mobile 3.0. BA role can make a huge impact. Perhaps more than any other role. Thank you.

TUE MAY 14

Low EQ

They believe the world is against them, and that it’s never their fault. They can’t deal with frustration or manage their emotions, so they are prone to combative, aggressive, and at times, manipulative behavior in order to bully others into getting what they want.

https://www.aconsciousrethink.com/5098/deal-emotionally-unintelligent-people/  
                                         
If escape is not an immediate option, you can take the following steps to protect yourself from the low EQ family, friends and neighbors in your life.

Don’t engage. When it comes to family, or neighbors, while you can’t completely ignore them, you can certainly disengage. They can only continue their hurtful behavior if they’re getting a response. If you act disinterested, or stop responding, they will realize they’re having a conversation with themselves and go where they’re sure to get a reaction. People with low EQ are selfish, so if the conversation no longer revolves around them, and they are no longer getting the attention they crave, they will disappear and get it elsewhere.

Talk it out, act on it. Alternatively, when you can’t run, or the stakes are too high, it may be best to stand your ground and talk it out. This is especially the case in close family situations where it’s a parent or sibling who is being hurtful. Point out when they are overstepping your boundaries, how they make you feel, and what you will do if they continue this behavior. Then follow through every time the behavior rears its ugly head. People with low EQ don’t tend to have great listening skills, so sometimes the best way to get through to them, and protect yourself, is by establishing firm consequences for bad behavior.

5 other species of humans existed. The species that had a stronger behavioral drive that led to more complex systems won. This was driven by what Freud called one of the two main high level behavior drivers and later dewey said it as: the need to feel important.

THU APR 18
----------
A basic principle behind RSA is the observation that it is practical to find three very large positive integers e, d and n such that with modular exponentiation for all integers m (with 0 ≤ m < n):

(m^e)^d = m (mod n)

and that even knowing e and n or even m it can be extremely difficult to find d.

In addition, for some operations it is convenient that the order of the two exponentiations can be changed and that this relation also implies:

(m^d)^e = m (mod n)

Encryption
c = m^e (mod n)

Decryption
c^d=(m^e)^d (mod n)

TUE APR 2
---------
The reason why a lot of people are working those longer hours, is not because there’s 12 hours of work to do, it’s because they can’t find time within those 12 hours to actually get a few contiguous hours of time to actually do the work they need to do. So their work is spread across so many different things in so many different places in a given day, that they can’t piece it together in a relatively short period of time. So it’s spread out and that’s why people are working longer, it’s not that there’s more work to do.

5 Whys
Q: Why do we keep doing the same thing over and over?
A: Perceived as safer/proven; more efficient.

Q: Why is it perceived as safer/proven?
A: Because software is so unreliable and does need to be proven.

Q: Why is software so unreliable?
A: Type system. Mutability. No one can grok it.

Q: Why is software so hard to grok?
A: Understanding state. For example, just the combination of 6 32 bit integers is more atoms than in universe. And state changes.

Q: How can type system and mutability add to unreliability? 
A: We have focus on primitive types such as string for email. Null-pointer. $6 billion dollar mistake. Composability.

The Corda network is best represented as a fully-connected graph containing nodes.
There is no global broadcast or gossip network on Corda.
Corda nodes discover each other via a network map service. 
Each Corda node includes a vault, and every vault contains facts.
These facts can be shared with other nodes on the network.
The Corda Ledger is subjective from each peer's perspective.

Q: How to improve your creativity and productivity?

Accidental Creative Notes
Organize your world with a weekly checkpoint

Creative and productivity requires a rhythm. And eb and flow.
Install intentional checkpoints.

We need to incorporate what we learn.

Checkpoints creates traction. Creates friction. **They clarify opportunities.**

Don't let your systems become your master. Systems serve us.

5 Core Elements of Rhythm

FRESH
-----
Focus: how to allocate finite attention; be purposeful; q: within this project, what problem or set of problems am I tryhing to solve? All creative work is problem solving; easier to gain traction if you are focused on problems; our minds are wired to solve problems
Relationships: when we busy, relationships can fall to the waste side; Any open loops? Anyone you need to connect to ? Who are you going to inspire and push for the week? We need others to help us be as good as we can be.
Energy: what can you get rid of. rhythm. we are often good at managing time, but awful at managing energy. we tend to just add things.
Stimuli: gotta put great stuff in your head to create great stuff. to combine and sythensize
Hours: create time to think about our work; a step back. Unnecessary creating or backburning creating. Do something to grow or challenge yourself.

Notes: How to step out of your comfort zone. Accidental Creative.
Comfort is one of the most suductive forces on the planet.

When we take comfort over at expense of great work, we are not growing - taking chances - not pushing - not trying.

The poet.
“Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.” 

― Khalil Gibran, The Prophet 

Cause of the loss of passion. 
The love of comfort is often the enemy of greatness in our lives.

Notes: How to abstract over context by Martin Odersky
----------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiorT754IwA&index=8&t=0s&list=PLDxoMMAEmpqTea71WDnk9bG-HSe0soEIE

**Context is all around us**
+ the current configuration
+ the current scope
+ the security level in effect
+ the user on behalf of which an operation is performed

**Traditional ways to express context**
+ globals
    rigid if immutable
    unsafe if mutable
+ monkey patching (subclassing, nortel switch)
+ dependency injection
    at runtime
    or with macros
+ cake pattern
    close coupling + recursion

**implicit parameters**
def f(a: A)(implicit b: B)

implicit val b = B()

**context parameters**
def f(a: A)(implicit b: B)

In Scala 3.0, is now express as

def f(a: A) with (b: B)
or
def f(a: A) with B

instance ctx for Context { ... }
f("abc")
f("abc") with ctx

Summoning an instance
def summon[T] with (x: T) = x

**context parameters: use cases**
+ prove theorems
+ implement type classes
+ establish context
+ set configuration
+ inject dependencies
+ model capabilities

**Curry Howard isomporphism**
Types = Theorems
Programs = Proofs

Implicits and Contexts
----------------------
Use implicit parameters but almost never implicit conversions.

There are different mechanisms used to support context such as dependency injection, etc.
Implicits in scala support context in a more elegant way.

Implicit is the cononical way to represent contexts such as configuration, access rights, etc.

At PYPL this month, Scala is at #15 and none of the others show up.
At GitHut, Scala is at #12, Clojure is at #21, Elixir is at #24, and F# is at #37.
At IEEE Spectrum, Scala is at #15, Clojure is at #40, and none of the other show up.
What we can conclude is that only Scala is reasonably popular. All the other FP languages are relatively obscure.

superficial, narcissistic behavior, superiority complex, 

Perhaps, **unauthentic** would be better feedback.

Superiority complex
-------------------
 is a psychological defense mechanism that compensates for an inferiority complex. The term was coined by Alfred Adler as part of his school of individual psychology. Afred Adler. Austrian psychotherapist

 "If a person is a show-off, it is only because he feels inferior because he does not feel strong enough to compete with others on the useful side of life. That is why he stays on the useless side. He is not in harmony with society. It seems to be a trait of human nature that when individuals – both children and adults – feel weak, they want to solve the problems of life in such a way as to obtain personal superiority without any admixture of social interest. A superiority complex is a second phase. It is a compensation for the inferiority [feeling] complex."

 Dunning-Kruger Effect: people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess the cognitive ability as grater than it is.

 probably most dangerous: god complex.

Scala case class vs case object
------------------------------
Scala case classes are just regular classes which are immutable by default and decomposable through pattern matching.

A case class which has no arguments is declared as case object instead of case class. case object is serializeable by default.

trait PaymentMethod
case class CreditCard (number: string, expiration: Date) extends PaymentMethod
case class Cash (amount: decimal) extends PaymentMethod
case class Check (checkNumber : int) extends PaymentMehotd

Null: a Trait
null: an instance of Null- Similar to Java null
Nil: Represents an emptry List of anything of zero length. It's not that it refers to nothing but it refers to List which has no contents
Nothing is a Trait. It's a subtype of everything. But not superclass of anything. There are no instances of Nothing
None: Used to represent a sensible return value. Just to avoid null pointer exception. Option has exactly 2 subclasses- Some and None. None signifies no result from the method.
Unit: Type of method that doesn’t return a value of anys sort
